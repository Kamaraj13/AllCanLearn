**AllCanLearn** has been created by copying ai-roundtable_0.03 and adding quiz functionality!

## What's Working Now

### New Quiz Endpoints Added

🚧 Need to add Quiz UI section

## Next Step

I need to update the UI (index.html) to add:
1. Homepage with "Generate Podcast" and "Take Quiz" options
2. Quiz creator page (choose topic, difficulty)
3. Quiz player (answer questions)
4. Results page (score, leaderboard)

**Should I update the UI now to integrate quiz functionality?**

This will add a new section to the existing beautiful podcast UI.
